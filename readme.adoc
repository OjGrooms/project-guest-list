# Project Guestlist

This project is built to run on raspberryPi on rasberryPi 3B+. It is designed to interface with  
a disemboweled rotory phone, where the handset is terminated into retrofit mono 3.5mm audio jack  
and connected to a headphone/mic usb adapter, the receiver switch is interfaced with a GPIO 3.3v pin  
and a I/O pin to detect when the handset is lifted, and the rotor dial is not connected to anything.

This project can be expaned on to utilize the rotor for other purposes, but this specific application  
is as follows:

1. Let a user lift the handset off the rest and wait 2 seconds (to put the speaker to their ear)
2. Play a brief message instructing the user to leave a message
3. Record the message from the user until the handset is returned to the receiver or 120 seconds (2 minutes) pass
4. Save recording to the recordings folder

After the message is recorded, it will be saved to the folder with a timestamped title.

The preamble (section of audio that plays before recording the message) is a blocking audio clip,   
so the program will not continue until it's finished.

Recording is non-blocking, meaning that the program will continue while recording is taking place.  
This is important because at any point, the handset can be set back on the reciever, or the timer  
can fire and reset the state.
